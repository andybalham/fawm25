Heat, a spark, a light
The flames within

Restless minds inquire
In the night
Wondering if you've still got
The fight
Demons try to conquer
To avoid an encore
Itâ€™s time to battle
Cast off the shackles

[Chorus]
The flames within
Keep me burning
The flames within
Keep me turning
And when the dawn has come
Together we'll face the rising sun

Endless warfare waged
For the soul
Water getting in
Gotta plug the holes
Heat of the battle
Can't be diminished
Back in the saddle
The fight must be finished

[Chorus]

[Noodle]

[Chorus]
