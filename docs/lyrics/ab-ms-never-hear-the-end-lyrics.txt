It’s quite sobering that the man gets drunk
The fact he can drive while I’m all but sunk
I’ve known a thing or two so my vote’s out
My conscience is alive when I’m thrown out

We take it slow while they get up on speed
Can take from us what they then make us need
I’d break the flow if I could try again
My aching head is trapped in a pig pen

If this speaks to you then do speak again
Never let em have it, never hear the end
If I’m over the hill, you’re round the bend
Never let em have it, never hear the end

The assembly line aristocracy
never ever seemed quite all right to me
Oligarchy and the hypocrisy
Drink from an assassin’s cup greedily

Never let em have it, never hear the end
Never let em have it, never hear the end
