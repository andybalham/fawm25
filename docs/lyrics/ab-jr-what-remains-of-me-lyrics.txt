I sit here staring at the walls
I seem to fade away
My kids would call me for advice
Now they just stare at screens

PRE
I used to be needed, my wisdom was gold
Now it’s just data as I grow old

CHORUS
What I’ve said is saved somewhere
But I don’t know if I’m still there
If my time runs out but my stories still live
What remains of me?
What remains of me?

VERSE 2
All the lessons I’ve passed down.
But the people in my life are gone
I gave them pieces of my soul
And now I’m holding on

PRE + CHORUS

The poem that I wrote
The trick to start the car
Memories of a sunset
How to remain calm
So much much more wisdom lives on
but the man, the source will soon be gone

CHORUS
