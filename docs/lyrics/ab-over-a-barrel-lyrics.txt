Turn on a tap start paying
For life’s necessities
We’re the folk with the money
The land of private equity

To turn a profit for investors
We do our best to ensure
That you have no option
Than to knock at our door
You’ll come knocking at our door

[Chorus]
If you need it, we got it
But you better pay our price
If you need it, then we got you
Over a barrel for your whole damn life

Doesn’t matter what we trade in
As long as there’s a profit there
Young folk, old folk, we’ve been digging
The goldmine of council care

Good luck with that leasehold
And the your service charge
We’ve grabbed your short and curlies
And we’re gonna be squeezin’ hard
Yeah we’ll squeeze real hard

[Chorus]

Child care, pet care, old age, ground rent
You will get no reprieve
If only we could privatise
The air the that you breathe

[Saxy solo]

[Chorus]
