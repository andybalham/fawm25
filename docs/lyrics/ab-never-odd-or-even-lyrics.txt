Warning signs
There were warning signs
Warning signs
But no change of mind

Warning signs
Still more warning signs
Warning signs
But just stalling for time

[Chorus]
Never had a chance, never odd or even
Never had a chance, not even fleeting
Never had a chance, we were always beaten
Never had a chance, with our leaders

Rising tides
There are rising tides
Rising tides
But just deceit and lies

Rising tides
Disappearing lives
Rising tides
As they still deny

[Chorus]

Never had a chance, it’s profits first
Never had a chance, I fear the worst
Cashing in’s the main objective
Planet saving’s not cost effective
