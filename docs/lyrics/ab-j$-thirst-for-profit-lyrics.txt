Water, water everywhere but
not a drop to drink
We will steal your livelihood
In the time it takes to blink

Like a crap magician
Kicking up dust storm
Don't be afraid, you won't get paid,
Capitalistic norm

Take it away and sell it back
direct from the source
Charge you for your privilege
Take what's yours, by force

Whatever nature has to offer,
We will throttle it
Pay to pocket what is yours, 
At least we’ll bottle it

Thirst for profit
Thirst for profit
Thirst for profit

Why wouldn't we, why wouldn't we
Just because we can
Stealing, wheeler dealing, at
Least you'll get a tan

Its hedonism, we’re the villains
We should go to prison
But we've got clout, buy our way out
And resume our mission

Second chance, what's done is done
And we will always win
All this tension, no-one mention
Your grandkids looking thin

Why fight for what is right
When being wrong is easier
More rewarding to get hoarding
All your children's futures

Thirst for profit
Thirst for profit
Thirst for profit
