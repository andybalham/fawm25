Have you heard, it’s a dog-eat-dog life
Everybody wants a piece of your pie
Grabbing hands, grabbing all they can
If you’re not first, in with both hands

[Pre-chorus]
The law of the jungle
The fit will survive
Let free market
Have the right to decide

[Chorus]
A deal’s not a deal if no one got screwed
Who said life was fair?
There’s no winners if there are no losers
It’s a zero-sum game
They say a rising tide lifts all boats
But I wanna be the last afloat

Predator or prey, there can only be one
If you’re not exploiting, you’re being done
So squeeze ‘em tight for they’re worth
Or they’ll squeeze you till you’re fit to burst

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

But life’s not a jungle
Not rats in a sack
We’ve got to believe
We’re better than that
