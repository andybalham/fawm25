F**k off to Mars
F**k off to Mars
Take your cyber truck
And shove it up your arse

Money’s never enough
For the likes of you
You crave power
Over others too

Fostering hatred
By spreading your lies
F**king up
People’s lives, so

[Chorus]
F**k off to Mars
F**k off to Mars
Take your cyber truck
And shove it up your arse
F**k off to Mars
F**k off to Mars
Who died and
Put you c***s in charge

Twisted ideas of
Freedom of speech
You silence those
That disagree

Where there’s poverty
You see waste
What little they have you
Want to take away, so

[Chorus]
