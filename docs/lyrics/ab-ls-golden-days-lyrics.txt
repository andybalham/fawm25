I live in a darkened room
Venetian blinds just let shadows through
But I love this tomb to you
Memories get me through

Pre-chorus
You don’t love me how I like
Instead of affection, you turn the knife
But your attention is my only light
Could you love me again for one night?

Chorus:
I pray
For a golden day
Like we shared before our hearts decayed
I would throw
Throw my whole life away
Praying for one more golden day

I gave it all up to be
Witness to your misery
What pulled me in, what did I see
Now you’ve claimed all of me

Pre-chorus
Chorus

I’m hanging onto the memories
Stop being who I see in front of me
You promised me we could get back
Promise, promise you’ll come back
And though they are faraway
Let’s go back to those golden days
