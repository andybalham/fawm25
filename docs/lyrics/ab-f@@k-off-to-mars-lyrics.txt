F**k off to Mars
F**k off to Mars
Take your cyber truck
And shove it up your arse

Money is not enough
For the likes of you
You crave power
Over others too

You foster hatred
By spreading your lies
With no thought for
Other people’s lives, so

[Chorus]
F**k off to Mars
F**k off to Mars
Take your cyber truck
And shove it up your arse
F**k off to Mars
F**k off to Mars
Who died and
Put you in charge

Your twisted idea
Of freedom of speech
Built to silence
Those who disagree

And where there’s poor
You just see waste
What little they have you
Want to take away, so

[Chorus]
