Imagine the inefficiency
The lack of productivity
If workers were allowed to be
Involved in company policy

How would we ever get things done
If companies held elections
So time for countries to be run
By the hand of the chosen one

[Chorus]
All hail our dictator
His benevolence shines so bright
The great decision maker
Trust in him to do whatâ€™s right

Society can accelerate
With no electoral handbrake
Regulations set ablaze
Efficiency unconstrained

Ideas finally unleashed
In a free-market wet dream
By the tech ruling elite
And no one can disagree

[Chorus]

Now there might be some dissenters
Some may yearn to have a say
Time for some re-education
In a quiet faraway place
