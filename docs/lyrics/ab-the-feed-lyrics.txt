I am the feed
And I steal your time
I will never stop
And you’ll be mine
Forever scrolling
In search of dopamine
Pecking for pellets
On your screen

I am the feed
And I know
I have seen
Inside your soul
Every hesitation
Every subtle move
Guides me to know
What next to do

I am the feed
I will be your guide
I will take you
To your darkest side
Before you realise
You’re down the rabbit hole
And I have you
Under my control
