It looks we’ve got a problem
And something has got to give
It seems that we have too many folk
Economically inactive

We need to think different
The answers are in the lab
Can we cure these workshy fops
With just a single jab

[Chorus]
Yes, let’s jab the jobless
A needle and the job is done
One sharp prick is all it takes
For the perfect automaton
Let’s jab the jobless
Inject all those mugs
Get this country working again
Even if it is on drugs

We’ll start with just weight loss
But maybe there’s a greater need
GDP would be through the roof
If all workers were high on speed

Production both night and day
Recession but a memory
Profits stratospheric 
When there’s no need to sleep

[Chorus]

Is this chemical solution
Treating the symptom, not the cause
Maybe the jobs on offer
Aren’t worth applying for?
