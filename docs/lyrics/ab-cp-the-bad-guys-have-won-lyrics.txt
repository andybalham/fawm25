Hey, little man, come sit by my side,
There's something I can no longer hide
The world's not the place that I thought it'd become,
And son, it looks like the bad guys have won.

I promised you stars, I promised you light,
But the shadows grew longer, they swallowed the night.
The good we believed in, it's come undone,
but son, it looks like the bad guys have won.

[Chorus]
But don't lose all heart, don't you dare run,
The fight is not over, it'll never be done.
We'll rise from the ashes, we'll find the sun,
Even if today it feels like they've won.

I taught you to stand, to speak what is true,
To fight for the many, not just the few.
But the loudest of voices drowned out the hum,
but son, it looks like the bad guys won.

They traded their kindness for power and gold,
They sold out the future, the young and the old.
But the seeds that we planted, they've just begun,
even if son, it looks like the bad guys have won.

[Chorus]

The night may be long, but the dawn's still to come,
the battles may be lost but the wars still to be won.
So hold on to hope, the end is not done
The world's still worth saving for everyone

So take my hand, we'll walk through the storm,
Together we'll build and try to reform
The future's still yours, it's yours to become,
And son, we'll outlast coz the bad guys ain't won.

[Chorus]
