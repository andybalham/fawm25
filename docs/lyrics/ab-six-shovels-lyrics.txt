They gather outside McDonalds
Waiting for their phones to beep
Hoping for that notification
To claim their delivery fee

No one knows the outcome
A black box will decide
Which one’s blessed by the algorithm
And is sent inside

[Chorus 1]
Six shovels
Six shovels against a wall
Desperation
Desperation fuels it all
Six shovels, a hundred men

We need to be making more money
How to make the profits rise?
Make everyone self-employed
And avoid those workers’ rights

Let’s have a modern day shovel race
With rules no one understands
Make them fight for a pittance
On fear of being banned

[Chorus 1]

Taking risks between rush hour cars
For fresh milk and those Mars bars
E-bike fire claims innocent lives
Cost of convenient burger and fries

[Chorus 2]
Six shovels
Six shovels against a wall
Exploitation
Exploitation behind it all
Six shovels, a hundred men
