We’ve got the frontier spirit 
The American dream
We’ve got crypto millions
A CEO king

Unhappy with the tax
Deep state make you pay
Then switch to Praxis
For a better way

[Chorus]
The free-market crypto-city
That’s built for you
Constructed with vitality
And heroic virtue
Heroic virtue
Heroic virtue 

Get onboard with tech bros
Who can do no wrong
Disrupting industries
Complacent for too long

Take old institutions
Start-up mentality
Mix in AI
For max efficiency

[Chorus]

It’s a brave new world
Free from regulation
Where entrepreneurs
Seed innovation

Long on vision
Short on how
Ignore those doubts
And switch to Praxis now!
