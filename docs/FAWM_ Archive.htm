            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>F**k off to Mars
<br>F**k off to Mars
<br>Take your cyber truck
<br>And shove it up your arse
<br><br>Money is not enough
<br>For the likes of you
<br>You crave power
<br>Over others too
<br><br>You foster hatred
<br>By spreading your lies
<br>With no thought for
<br>Other people’s lives, so
<br><br>[Chorus]
<br>F**k off to Mars
<br>F**k off to Mars
<br>Take your cyber truck
<br>And shove it up your arse
<br>F**k off to Mars
<br>F**k off to Mars
<br>Who died and
<br>Put you in charge
<br><br>Your twisted idea
<br>Of freedom of speech
<br>Built to silence
<br>Those who disagree
<br><br>And where there’s poor
<br>You just see waste
<br>What little they have you
<br>Want to take away, so
<br><br>[Chorus]</p>

            <h2>2. The Benevolent Dictator</h2>
            
            <p>2025-02-02</p>
            <p>I thought that the idea of preferring a dictator to 
democracy was an idea only put forward by tech bros, but apparently not.
 According to a YouGov poll, it would seem that 20% of Britons would 
prefer a dictator to having a say in things:

            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>Imagine the inefficiency
<br>The lack of productivity
<br>If workers were allowed to be
<br>Involved in company policy
<br><br>How would we ever get things done
<br>If companies held elections
<br>So time for countries to be run
<br>By the hand of the chosen one
<br><br>[Chorus]
<br>All hail our dictator
<br>His benevolence shines so bright
<br>The great decision maker
<br>Trust in him to do what’s right
<br><br>Society can accelerate
<br>With no electoral handbrake
<br>Regulations set ablaze
<br>Efficiency unconstrained
<br><br>Ideas finally unleashed
<br>In a free-market wet dream
<br>By the tech ruling elite
<br>And no one can disagree
<br><br>[Chorus]
<br><br>Now there might be some dissenters
<br>Some may yearn to have a say
<br>Time for some re-education
<br>In a quiet faraway place</p>

            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>It’s quite sobering that the man gets drunk
<br>The fact he can drive while I’m all but sunk
<br>I’ve known a thing or two so my vote’s out
<br>My conscience is alive when I’m thrown out
<br><br>We take it slow while they get up on speed
<br>Can take from us what they then make us need
<br>I’d break the flow if I could try again
<br>My aching head is trapped in a pig pen
<br><br>If this speaks to you then do speak again
<br>Never let em have it, never hear the end
<br>If I’m over the hill, you’re round the bend
<br>Never let em have it, never hear the end
<br><br>The assembly line aristocracy
<br>never ever seemed quite all right to me
<br>Oligarchy and the hypocrisy
<br>Drink from an assassin’s cup greedily
<br><br>Never let em have it, never hear the end
<br>Never let em have it, never hear the end</p>

            <p>It looks we’ve got a problem
<br>And something has got to give
<br>It seems that we have too many folk
<br>Economically inactive
<br><br>We need to think different
<br>The answers are in the lab
<br>Can we cure these workshy fops
<br>With just a single jab
<br><br>[Chorus]
<br>Yes, let’s jab the jobless
<br>A needle and the job is done
<br>One sharp prick is all it takes
<br>For the perfect automaton
<br>Let’s jab the jobless
<br>Inject all those mugs
<br>Get this country working again
<br>Even if it is on drugs
<br><br>We’ll start with just weight loss
<br>But maybe there’s a greater need
<br>GDP would be through the roof
<br>If all workers were high on speed
<br><br>Production both night and day
<br>Recession but a memory
<br>Profits stratospheric
<br>When there’s no need to sleep
<br><br>[Chorus]
<br><br>Is this chemical solution
<br>Treating the symptom, not the cause
<br>Maybe the jobs on offer
<br>Aren’t worth applying for?</p>

<br><br>Another slice of fun made with my long-term musical collaborator and good friend, mister @andybalham 
<br><br>This is not my title, it's from songfight.org (a weekly music 
competition website.  They give you a title and you write a song to it. 
 Repeat, in my case, for longer than I've been doing FAWM).  You should 
check it out, if such things interest you.
<br><br>I've tagged this as NSFW even though I'm not sure it is.  If 
that term means it's got swears in it, then ok, but where the hell do 
you work; in Heaven? :)</p>
            
            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>You have got an oral fixation
<br>Too many massive cocks round here
<br>Mouth wide enough to blow the nation?
<br>It would still take you years and years
<br><br>I don’t care at all 
<br>How you get your thrills
<br>Watching empires fall
<br>Is all that pays my bills
<br><br>You have got an anal fixation
<br>So many big assholes around here
<br>It’s going to take some real patience
<br>To locate the biggest rear
<br><br>I don’t care at all 
<br>How you get your thrills
<br>Watching empires fall
<br>Is all that pays my bills
<br><br>Fixation …
<br>Fixation …
<br><br>You have got a phallic fixation
<br>Helluva lot of enormous dicks
<br>Can’t decide which one’s the biggest?
<br>Try them out for size; take your pick
<br><br>I don’t care at all 
<br>How you get your thrills
<br>Watching empires fall
<br>Is all that pays my bills.</p>

            <p>Big thanks to @negasi for the lyrics. Since the words 
were inspired by listening to the Hoff, I couldn't resist. I hope I have
 done them justice. I tried for metal, but I think it came out more 
straight rock. It was fun though. The original non-tweaked lyrics can be

            <p>Heat, a spark, a light
<br>The flames within
<br><br>Restless minds inquire
<br>In the night
<br>Wondering if you've still got
<br>The fight
<br>Demons try to conquer
<br>To avoid an encore
<br>It’s time to battle
<br>Cast off the shackles
<br><br>[Chorus]
<br>The flames within
<br>Keep me burning
<br>The flames within
<br>Keep me turning
<br>And when the dawn has come
<br>Together we'll face the rising sun
<br><br>Endless warfare waged
<br>For the soul
<br>Water getting in
<br>Gotta plug the holes
<br>Heat of the battle
<br>Can't be diminished
<br>Back in the saddle
<br>The fight must be finished

            <p>I sit here staring at the walls
<br>I seem to fade away
<br>My kids would call me for advice
<br>Now they just stare at screens
<br><br>PRE
<br>I used to be needed, my wisdom was gold
<br>Now it’s just data as I grow old
<br><br>CHORUS
<br>What I’ve said is saved somewhere
<br>But I don’t know if I’m still there
<br>If my time runs out but my stories still live
<br>What remains of me?
<br>What remains of me?
<br><br>VERSE 2
<br>All the lessons I’ve passed down.
<br>But the people in my life are gone
<br>I gave them pieces of my soul
<br>And now I’m holding on
<br><br>PRE + CHORUS
<br><br>The poem that I wrote
<br>The trick to start the car
<br>Memories of a sunset
<br>How to remain calm
<br>So much much more wisdom lives on
<br>but the man, the source will soon be gone
<br><br>CHORUS</p>

<br>Who said life was fair?
<br>There’s no winners if there are no losers

<br>They say a rising tide lifts all boats
<br>But I wanna be the last afloat
<br><br>Predator or prey, there can only be one
<br>If you’re not exploiting, you’re being done
<br>So squeeze ‘em tight for they’re worth
<br>Or they’ll squeeze you till you’re fit to burst

<br>Not rats in a sack

 work with as part of Round #3 of the Random Collaboration challenge and
 for the lyrics. It was a lot of fun coming up with the music and 
hopefully I have done the words justice.

            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>I live in a darkened room
<br>Venetian blinds just let shadows through
<br>But I love this tomb to you
<br>Memories get me through
<br><br>Pre-chorus
<br>You don’t love me how I like
<br>Instead of affection, you turn the knife
<br>But your attention is my only light
<br>Could you love me again for one night?
<br><br>Chorus:
<br>I pray
<br>For a golden day
<br>Like we shared before our hearts decayed
<br>I would throw
<br>Throw my whole life away
<br>Praying for one more golden day
<br><br>I gave it all up to be
<br>Witness to your misery
<br>What pulled me in, what did I see
<br>Now you’ve claimed all of me
<br><br>Pre-chorus
<br>Chorus
<br><br>I’m hanging onto the memories
<br>Stop being who I see in front of me
<br>You promised me we could get back
<br>Promise, promise you’ll come back
<br>And though they are faraway
<br>Let’s go back to those golden days</p>

            <p>Big thanks to @coolparadiso for coming up with the lyrics
 on this one. All I had was a couple of lines as a prompt and John took 
those and really ran with them. It was a lot of fun to put the music 
together for them and it does them justice.

            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>Hey, little man, come sit by my side,
<br>There's something I can no longer hide
<br>The world's not the place that I thought it'd become,
<br>And son, it looks like the bad guys have won.
<br><br>I promised you stars, I promised you light,
<br>But the shadows grew longer, they swallowed the night.
<br>The good we believed in, it's come undone,
<br>but son, it looks like the bad guys have won.
<br><br>[Chorus]
<br>But don't lose all heart, don't you dare run,
<br>The fight is not over, it'll never be done.
<br>We'll rise from the ashes, we'll find the sun,
<br>Even if today it feels like they've won.
<br><br>I taught you to stand, to speak what is true,
<br>To fight for the many, not just the few.
<br>But the loudest of voices drowned out the hum,
<br>but son, it looks like the bad guys won.
<br><br>They traded their kindness for power and gold,
<br>They sold out the future, the young and the old.
<br>But the seeds that we planted, they've just begun,
<br>even if son, it looks like the bad guys have won.
<br><br>[Chorus]
<br><br>The night may be long, but the dawn's still to come,
<br>the battles may be lost but the wars still to be won.
<br>So hold on to hope, the end is not done
<br>The world's still worth saving for everyone
<br><br>So take my hand, we'll walk through the storm,
<br>Together we'll build and try to reform
<br>The future's still yours, it's yours to become,
<br>And son, we'll outlast coz the bad guys ain't won.
<br><br>[Chorus]</p>

                    <blockquote>John, one of the best things you can do 
with music is give people *hope*, and your lyric is permeated with it. 
You could so easily have come up with 'The Bad Guys Have Won (a hooky 
title) and left it at that or written something dystopian and dark. That
 would have been appropriate to the situation, but you did so much more.
 Facing the situation head-on and still saying: the war isn't over, the 
dawn is coming, the seeds will grow...; and framing it all as advice to a
 child -- great stuff! I love the detail as you explain how and why it 
happened, and why there must be hope. I'm 100% with you on this. I like 
the music a lot: it's grungy and urgent, and still upbeat and hopeful, 
perfect for this message.</blockquote>
