      I thought that the idea of preferring a dictator to democracy was an idea only put forward by tech bros, but apparently not.
      Apparently 20% of Britons would prefer a dictator to democracy, according to a YouGov poll:
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/12/one-in-five-britons-aged-18-45-prefer-unelected-leaders-to-democracy-poll-finds">The Guardian - One in five Britons aged 18-45 prefer unelected leaders to democracy, poll finds</a>
