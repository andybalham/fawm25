      I thought that the idea of preferring a dictator to democracy was an idea only put forward by tech bros, but apparently not.
      Apparently 20% of Britons would prefer a dictator to democracy, according to a YouGov poll:

      Where I take the idea of using weight loss jabs for the unemployed to its logical conclusion.
      Sadly, this is not a dystopian idea I made up. It's a real thing that's been proposed by a UK MP:

      Railing against the neo-liberal idea that life is a zero-sum game, and that we should all be pitted against each other in a battle over limited resources. I'm not advocating communism, but I am advocating a more compassionate form of capitalism.
