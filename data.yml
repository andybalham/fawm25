      This could be a song about anybody. Read into it what you will.
  - title: The Benevolent Dictator

      I thought that the idea of preferring a dictator to democracy was an idea only put forward by tech bros, but apparently not.
      Apparently 20% of Britons would prefer a dictator to democracy, according to a YouGov poll:

  - title: Jabbing The Jobless

      Where I take the idea of using weight loss jabs for the unemployed to its logical conclusion.
      Sadly, this is not a dystopian idea I made up. It's a real thing that's been proposed by a UK MP:

  - title: Zero-Sum Game
    mp3Filename: ab-zero-sum-game
    notes: |
      Railing against the neo-liberal idea that life is a zero-sum game, and that we should all be pitted against each other in a battle over limited resources. I'm not advocating communism, but I am advocating a more compassionate form of capitalism.

      Are we the dog wagging the tail, or are we the tail being wagged by the dog? And where is the dog going?
  - title: Six Shovels

      When they were digging canals, there were more men than jobs. To decide who got the job, they would place shovels against a wall and the desperate men would race to be the first to grab one and get employed. How times have changed.
  - title: Never Hear The End

      Lyrics by @makessense, who I was paired with in the random collaboration challenge. Big thanks to him for the lyrics after I asked for something along the lines of how I get frustrated with those who wield great wealth and power and would rather keep the status quo than make a better world.
  - title: Over A Barrel
    mp3Filename: ab-over-a-barrel

      Private equity has us over a barrel. Whether we want child care, social care, a vet, or anything we can't do without.
  - title: Never Odd Or Even

      My song in the palindrome challenge. Stretching the palanindromic title a bit, but it kind of works if you squint.
