      This could be a song about anybody. Read into it what you will.
  - title: The Benevolent Dictator
    mp3Filename: ab-benevolent-dictator
    notes: |
      I thought that the idea of preferring a dictator to democracy was an idea only put forward by tech bros, but apparently not.
      Apparently 20% of Britons would prefer a dictator to democracy, according to a YouGov poll:

  - title: Jabbing The Jobless
    mp3Filename: ab-jabbing-the-jobless

      Where I take the idea of using weight loss jabs for the unemployed to its logical conclusion.
      Sadly, this is not a dystopian idea I made up. It's a real thing that's been proposed by a UK MP:

  - title: Zero-Sum Game
    mp3Filename: ab-zero-sum-game
    notes: |
      Railing against the neo-liberal idea that life is a zero-sum game, and that we should all be pitted against each other in a battle over limited resources. I'm not advocating communism, but I am advocating a more compassionate form of capitalism.
  - title: (I Am) The Feed
    mp3Filename: ab-the-feed
    notes: |
      Are we the dog wagging the tail, or are we the tail being wagged by the dog? And where is the dog going?
  - title: Six Shovels
    mp3Filename: ab-six-shovels
    notes: |
      When they were digging canals, there were more men than jobs. To decide who got the job, they would place shovels against a wall and the desperate men would race to be the first to grab one and get employed. How times have changed.
  - title: Never Hear The End

      Lyrics by @makessense, who I was paired with in the random collaboration challenge. Big thanks to him for the lyrics after I asked for something along the lines of how I get frustrated with those who wield great wealth and power and would rather keep the status quo than make a better world.
  - title: Over A Barrel
    mp3Filename: ab-over-a-barrel
    notes: |
      Private equity has us over a barrel. Whether we want child care, social care, a vet, or anything we can't do without.
  - title: Never Odd Or Even
    mp3Filename: ab-never-odd-or-even
    notes: |
      My song in the palindrome challenge. Stretching the palanindromic title a bit, but it kind of works if you squint.
  - title: Into The Wood Chipper
    mp3Filename: ab-into-the-woodchipper
    notes: |
      Another song 'inspired' by the acts of a certain odious individual. Who is seemingly hell bent on tearing everything down in order to build according to their own selfish ideology.
  - title: The Flames Within
    mp3Filename: ab-n-the-flames-within
    notes: |
      Big thanks to @negasi for the lyrics. Since the lyrics were inspired by listening to the Hoff, I couldn't resist. I hope I have done them justice. I tried for metal, but it came out more straight rock I think. It was fun though. The original non-tweaked lyrics can be found here: https://write.fawm.org/songs/305388
  - title: What Remains Of Me?
    mp3Filename: ab-jr-what-remains-of-me
    notes: |
      Big thanks to @johnrupe for the lyrics in Round #2 of the random collaboration challenge. The song is from the viewpoint of an older gentlemen ruminating on life, the internet, and his place in the world.
  - title: Thirst For Profit
    mp3Filename: ab-j$-thirst-for-profit

      Big thanks to @johnnycashpoint for the lyrics on this one. These were prompted by the story about the Spanish villages where people are forced to buy back their own drinking water: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/23/spanish-villages-people-forced-to-buy-back-own-drinking-water-drought-flood
  - title: Praxis of Evil
    mp3Filename: ab-praxis-of-evil
    notes: |
      To quote the article 'The crypto bros who dream of crowdfunding a new country', Praxis is a tech start-up that plans to create a new sovereign state somewhere on the Mediterranean coast, part of a new tech movement called 'the network state'. The idea is that these statelets, governed not by a giant state bureaucracy but on the blockchain, will eventually replace the nation state.: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyl171lyewo
      Big thanks to 'Streaky' Bateman for the lead guitar work ðŸ¤˜
